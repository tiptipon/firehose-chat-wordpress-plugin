== Description ==

Chat with visitors on your website.

When you open this app, we give you a code snippet to paste into the HTML of your website and that's it! You'll see a list of everyone who is on your website in this app. They'll see a chat box in the bottom right of your website. You can chat with them, they can chat with you.

Features you get for free:

* Try it out without entering any information (name, email, etc) or installing anything on your website. Chat with yourself or coworkers. If you like what you see, it's super easy to install on your own website.
* Easy to install. Just paste some code onto your website and you'll see everyone on your site in this app.
* See a live list of everyone on your website.
* Visitors can expand the chat box on your website to start chatting.
* You can initiate a chat with anyone on your site. Their chat box will pop open and make a sound.
* You can receive a push notification to your iPhone, iPad, iPod Touch and Mac when someone wants to chat, even if the app isn't open.
* You can set "do not disturb" hours that determine if the chat box allows visitors to try and live chat with you.
* If you are not available, meaning you are in "do not disturb" mode, visitors can leave their e-mail and a message so you can respond later.
* See helpful information about each visitor: What website (if any) referred them to your site, how long they've been on your site, how long they've been on the current page, what type of browser/operating system they are using, what city they are in, etc.
* Create an account so you can log in on all your devices.
* You can see when visitors are typing and they can see when you are typing.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Wait, what is this thing again? =
This is a service called Firehose Chat. It makes it easy to carry on live conversations with people who visit your site.

= How does it work? =
Well, you (or your resident web guy) copy and paste a small chunk of code into the HTML of your webpage. This makes a small chat window appear on your site that people can type messages into. Then you can use our Mac or iOS apps to answer questions as they come in.

= What if I’m offline? =
Our apps are push-based. So even if they’re not open, you can allow them to notify you that someone wants to chat. On the phone it feels just like texting with someone from your lock screen. It’s kinda magical.

= How does Firehose Chat benefit my business? =
You probably get a lot more traffic than you realize, but customers often leave after getting confused and you’re none the wiser. Firehose Chat helps you engage those customers before they leave. You’ll see increased customer satisfaction and find out what the pain points of your website are.

=	Why are you better than other similar services? =
All the features above with an “Exclusive” badge. Also, two big things: We have custom native apps built specifically for our service, an awesome Mac app and an equally awesome iOS app coming soon. Second, you don’t have to have the app open, you can get push notifications whenever a visitor wants to chat, so you can always be an iPhone/iPad lock screen slide away from answering a visitor who wants to chat. Oh, and our pricing is WAY better and it’s one flat rate for unlimited agents. No one else has that.

= Is it really free? =
Yes, the basic version is free. If you want to customize the chat box, remove the Firehose branding, view history or have multiple agents, you’ll need to upgrade. A subscription is only $7 a month, regardless of the number of agents or websites you install it on.

=	Can I customize the look of the chat window? =
Yep, with a paid account you have complete control including color, placement, intro text, etc. You can even edit the CSS right in the app if you’re so inclined.

=	Wait, how many websites can I install it on? =
As many as you need, but we do ask that you exercise restraint. Think of the children.

=	And how many users/employees/agents can I add? =
With a paid account, as many as you want. 20 agents costs the same as 1.
